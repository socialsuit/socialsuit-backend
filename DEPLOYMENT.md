# Production Deployment Guide for Social Suit and Sparkr

## Deploying on Render.com

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for deploying the Social Suit and Sparkr applications on Render.com with zero errors.

### Prerequisites

1. A Render.com account
2. Your codebase pushed to a Git repository (GitHub, GitLab, etc.)
3. API keys and credentials for all required services (see the .env files)

### Deployment Steps

#### 1. Prepare Your Repository

1. Ensure your codebase is in a Git repository (GitHub, GitLab, etc.)
2. Verify that all files are committed, including:
   - Dockerfiles (optimized for production with Gunicorn + Uvicorn)
   - render.yaml (with proper service configurations)
   - .env files (with placeholders for sensitive information)

#### 2. Connect Your Repository to Render

1. Log in to your Render dashboard at https://dashboard.render.com
2. Click on "New" and select "Blueprint"
3. Connect your Git repository by selecting the appropriate provider
4. Select the repository containing the Social Suit and Sparkr code
5. Choose the branch you want to deploy (default: main)

#### 3. Configure Environment Variables

1. After connecting your repository, Render will detect the `render.yaml` file
2. For each service, you'll need to configure environment variables
3. Use the values from your .env files, replacing placeholders with actual values:
   - For database URLs, use the values provided by Render for managed databases
   - For Redis URLs, use the values provided by Render for managed Redis
   - For sensitive information (API keys, secrets), enter your actual values

**Important:** Generate secure values for the following:
   - `JWT_SECRET` (use a secure random string generator)
   - `SECRET_KEY` (use a secure random string generator)
   - `SECURITY_PASSWORD_SALT` (use a secure random string generator)

#### 4. Deploy the Blueprint

1. Review all service configurations to ensure they match your requirements
2. Click "Apply Blueprint" to start the deployment process
3. Render will automatically create all services defined in `render.yaml`:
   - Social Suit web service (with autoscaling)
   - Sparkr web service (with autoscaling)
   - Social Suit worker service (with autoscaling)
   - Sparkr worker service (with autoscaling)
   - PostgreSQL databases (social-suit-db and sparkr-db)
   - Redis instances (social-suit-redis and sparkr-redis)

#### 5. Verify the Deployment

1. Monitor the build and deployment logs for each service
2. Check the health endpoints for web services:
   - Social Suit: https://social-suit.onrender.com/health
   - Sparkr: https://sparkr.onrender.com/health
3. Verify database connections by checking application logs
4. Test worker functionality by triggering background tasks

### Scaling Services

#### Autoscaling Configuration

Both web and worker services are configured with autoscaling in the `render.yaml` file:
- Minimum instances: 2
- Maximum instances: 6

This ensures your application can handle varying loads efficiently while optimizing costs.

#### Manual Scaling Adjustments

If you need to adjust the autoscaling parameters:

1. Navigate to the service in your Render dashboard
2. Click on "Settings"
3. Under "Autoscaling", adjust the minimum and maximum instances
4. Save changes

#### Scaling Databases

1. Navigate to the database in your Render dashboard
2. Click on "Settings"
3. Choose a higher plan with more resources
4. Confirm the upgrade

#### Performance Monitoring

1. Use Render's built-in metrics to monitor CPU and memory usage
2. Set up alerts for high resource utilization
3. Consider implementing application-level metrics with Prometheus or similar tools

### Troubleshooting

#### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **Build Failures**
   - Check the build logs for specific error messages
   - Verify that all dependencies are correctly specified in requirements.txt
   - Ensure Dockerfiles are correctly configured for your application
   - Check for syntax errors in your code

2. **Database Connection Errors**
   - Verify the `POSTGRES_URL` environment variable is correctly set with the Render-provided connection string
   - Check if the database service is running in your Render dashboard
   - Ensure your application's database models match the schema
   - Check for firewall or network issues between services

3. **Redis Connection Errors**
   - Verify the `REDIS_URL` environment variable is correctly set with the Render-provided connection string
   - Check if the Redis service is running in your Render dashboard
   - Ensure Redis password is correctly configured if authentication is enabled
   - Check for firewall or network issues between services

4. **Worker Not Processing Tasks**
   - Check worker logs for specific error messages
   - Verify Redis connection is working (Celery uses Redis as a broker)
   - Ensure Celery is configured correctly with the right queue names
   - Check that task definitions are properly imported and registered
   - Verify that the worker service has the correct environment variables

5. **Web Service Errors**
   - Check application logs for specific error messages
   - Verify that the health endpoint is correctly implemented
   - Ensure all required environment variables are set
   - Check for memory or CPU constraints that might be causing crashes

#### Effective Log Analysis

1. Navigate to the service in your Render dashboard
2. Click on "Logs" to view real-time logs
3. Use the search functionality to filter logs by:
   - Error level (ERROR, WARNING)
   - Service name
   - Timestamp
   - Specific keywords related to your issue
4. Set up log alerts for critical errors
5. Consider implementing structured logging in your application for better debugging

### Maintenance and Operations

#### Continuous Deployment

1. Push changes to your Git repository's main branch
2. Render will automatically detect changes and trigger a new build
3. Monitor the build logs to ensure successful deployment
4. For critical updates, consider using Render's Preview Environments feature to test changes before deploying to production

#### Database Management

1. **Regular Backups**
   - Navigate to the database in your Render dashboard
   - Click on "Backups"
   - Configure automatic daily backups
   - Periodically test backup restoration to ensure data integrity

2. **Database Migrations**
   - Use database migration tools (Alembic for SQLAlchemy)
   - Test migrations in a staging environment before applying to production
   - Schedule migrations during low-traffic periods
   - Always have a rollback plan

#### Monitoring and Observability

1. **Application Health**
   - Use the health endpoints (/health) to monitor service status
   - Set up external monitoring services (Uptime Robot, Pingdom)
   - Configure alerts for service outages

2. **Performance Metrics**
   - Monitor CPU, memory, and disk usage in Render dashboard
   - Track response times and error rates
   - Set up application-level metrics for business KPIs

3. **Cost Optimization**
   - Regularly review resource usage and adjust autoscaling parameters
   - Consider scaling down during predictable low-traffic periods
   - Monitor database and Redis usage to ensure appropriate sizing

### Security Best Practices

1. **Environment Variables**
   - Ensure all sensitive information is stored as environment variables
   - Regularly rotate API keys and secrets
   - Use Render's environment variable encryption

2. **Access Control**
   - Implement proper authentication and authorization in your application
   - Restrict access to Render dashboard to necessary personnel only
   - Use strong, unique passwords and enable 2FA where available

3. **Dependency Management**
   - Regularly update dependencies to patch security vulnerabilities
   - Use tools like Dependabot to automate security updates
   - Scan your code for security issues

4. **Network Security**
   - Enable HTTPS for all web services (Render provides this by default)
   - Configure appropriate CORS settings
   - Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
